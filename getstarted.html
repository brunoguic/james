        Download and install
    </h1>
    <p>
        Download and install the latest version of the James framework. You can either add a
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> dependency to automatically pull in all
        required packages or you can manually download and install the JAR-files. Alternatively,
        you can also get the source code from the <a href="https://www.github.com/hdbeukel/james">GitHub repository</a>
        and build James all by yourself. Using Maven, this only takes a few minutes. Build instructions are included in
        the GitHub README file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The James framework consists of several modules:
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Core Module</dt>
          <dd>
            As its name suggests, this module contains the core components of the framework.
            It includes many general utilities for both problem specification and search
            application.
            A wide range of generic local search algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including
            random descent, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search and parallel
            tempering (all algorithms are listed <a href="/docs/#algorithms">here</a>).
            Moreover, the core module contains implementations of abstract components for subset selection
            as well as some heuristics that have been specifially designed for subset sampling.
            <a href="https://github.com/hdbeukel/james/tree/master/james/james-core">

                GitHub
            </a>
          </dd>
          <dt>Extensions Module</dt>
          <dd>
            Extends the core with components to model and solve other types of problems besides
            subset selection (e.g. permutation problems). Also, general utilities for advanced problem specification,
            such as weighted multi-objective functions, are provided. This module is optional and should only be
            included if any of its components are used.
            <a href="https://github.com/hdbeukel/james/tree/master/james/james-extensions">
                <i class="fa fa-github"></i>

            </a>
          </dd>
          <dt>Examples Module</dt>
          <dd>
            Provides a series of example problem implementations, where several different optimization algorithms
            are applied to obtain solutions for the specified problems (see <a href="/examples">examples</a>).
            This module is intended for demonstration only and should not be included when using the framework.

    <h2 class="page-header">Releases</h2>
    
    <p>
        James is currently under development and no stable versions have yet been released.
        Subscribe to the <a href="/rss/james-releases.xml">RSS feed <i class="fa fa-rss"></i></a>
        to stay informed about upcoming releases.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="page-header">Development snapshots</h2>
    
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The current snapshot version is 0.1-SNAPSHOT.
    </div>
    <p>
        Bleeding edge development snapshots are frequently deployed to the
        <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org">Sonatype OSSRH</a>
        open source repository. Remember that snapshots are no stable releases
        and should therefore be used with care. For example, their API might
        change without notice and they may contain incomplete or insufficiently
        tested components.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h3>Maven</h3>
    <p>
        If you are using Maven, snapshots can be automatically retrieved by adding the Sonatype snapshots repository
        to your project's POM file:
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;repositories&gt;
  &lt;repository&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;snapshots-repo&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
</pre>      
    <p>
        The only thing that remains then is to specify the appropriate dependencies, e.g.
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.jamesframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;james-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
        or
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.jamesframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;james-extensions&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
        for the core and extensions modules, respectively. This will automatically retrieve the most recently
        published development snapshot of the specified module version.
    </p>
