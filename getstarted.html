        Download and install
    </h1>
    <p>
        Download and install the latest version of the James framework. You can either add a
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> dependency to automatically pull in all
        required packages or you can manually download and install the JAR files. Alternatively,
        you can also get the source code from the <a href="https://www.github.com/hdbeukel/james">GitHub repository</a>
        and build James all by yourself. Using Maven, this only takes a few minutes. Build instructions are included in
        the GitHub README file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The James framework consists of several modules:
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Core Module</dt>
          <dd>
            As its name suggests, this module contains the core components of the framework.
            It includes many general utilities for both problem specification and search
            application.
            A wide range of generic local search algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including
            random descent, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search and parallel
            tempering (all algorithms are listed <a href="/docs/#algorithms">here</a>).
            Moreover, the core module contains implementations of abstract components for subset selection
            as well as some heuristics that have been specifially designed for subset sampling.
            <a href="https://github.com/hdbeukel/james/tree/master/james/james-core">
                <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
                GitHub
            </a>
          </dd>
          <dt>Extensions Module</dt>
          <dd>
            Extends the core with components to model and solve other types of problems besides
            subset selection (e.g. permutation problems). Also, general utilities for advanced problem specification,
            such as weighted multi-objective functions, are provided. This module is optional and should only be
            included if any of its components are used.
            <a href="https://github.com/hdbeukel/james/tree/master/james/james-extensions">
                <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
                GitHub
            </a>
          </dd>
          <dt>Examples Module</dt>
          <dd>
            Provides a series of example problem implementations, where several different optimization algorithms
            are applied to obtain solutions for the specified problems (see <a href="/examples">examples</a>).
            This module is intended for demonstration only and should not be included when using the framework.

    </p>
    
    <h2 class="page-header">Dependencies</h2>
    
    <p>
        The James framework requires Java 7 or later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To perform logging, James depends on the <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)</a>,
        which is a general logging API that provides bindings for several popular Java logging frameworks including log4j,
        JDK 1.4 logging and logback. To send all log messages generated by James to your favorite logging framework, simply
        include the appropriate binding on your classpath as described in the
        <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html">SLF4J user manual</a>. If no binding is found, a warning
<pre>
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
</pre>
        is printed to the console and all log messages are silently discarded. If you do not mind about log messages it is
        perfectly safe to ignore this warning.
    </p>
            
    <h2 class="page-header">Releases</h2>
    
    <p>
        James is currently under development and no stable versions have yet been released.
        Subscribe to the <a href="/rss/james-releases.xml">RSS feed <i class="fa fa-rss"></i></a>
        to stay informed about upcoming releases.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="page-header">Development snapshots</h2>

    <p>
        Bleeding edge development snapshots are frequently deployed to the <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org">Sonatype OSSRH</a>
        open source repository.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <strong>
            <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Warning!
        </strong>
        Remember that snapshots are no stable releases
        and should therefore be used with care. For example, their API might
        change without notice and they may contain incomplete or insufficiently
        tested components. We strongly recommend to use a stable release instead.
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>
            <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Current snapshot version:
        </strong>
        {{ site.snapshotversion }}
    </div>
    
    
    <h3>Maven</h3>
    
    <p>
        If you are using Maven, snapshots can be automatically retrieved by adding the Sonatype snapshots repository
        to your project's POM file:
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;repositories&gt;
  &lt;repository&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;snapshots-repo&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
</pre>      
    <p>
        The only thing that remains then is to include the appropriate dependencies:
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.jamesframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;james-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;{{ site.snapshotversion }}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
        and (optionally)
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.jamesframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;james-extensions&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;{{ site.snapshotversion }}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
        for the core and extensions modules, respectively. This will automatically retrieve the most recently
        published development snapshot of the specified module version.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Plain-old JARs</h3>
    
    <p>
        Alternatively, you can manually grab the latest snapshots of the required JAR files and put them on your classpath:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.jamesframework&a=james-core&v={{ site.snapshotversion }}&e=jar">james-core.jar</a></li>
        <li>[optional] <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.jamesframework&a=james-extensions&v={{ site.snapshotversion }}&e=jar">james-extensions.jar</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Do not forget to also include the SLF4J api:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.slf4j%22%20slf4j-api">slf4j-api.jar</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Examples module package</h3>
    
    <p>
        For the examples module, a ZIP package is provided that contains all Java sources, a compiled JAR (including all dependencies)
        and example input files. The latest snapshot of this package can be retrieved
        <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.jamesframework&a=james-examples&v=0.1-SNAPSHOT&e=zip">here</a>.
    </p>
