James Core Module
=================

The James core module is part of the [James framework][1].

The core module includes general concepts modeling problems, objectives, constraints, solutions, etc. It also contains generic metaheuristics to solve the problems, as well as implementations of specific components for subset selection.

A wide range of local search algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including

1. Random descent (basic local search)
2. Steepest descent
3. Tabu search
4. Variable neighbourhood search
5. Metropolis search
6. Parallel tempering

In addition, some specific subset sampling algorithms are available, as well as exhaustive search, which is of course only feasible for problems with a reasonably small, finite search space.

Status
======

*James core module is currently under development*
  
Documentation
=============
