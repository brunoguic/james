James core module
=================

This is the core module of the James framework for solving
combinatorial optimization problems using metaheuristics in java. 

The core module of James contains general concepts modeling
problems, objectives and constraints, as well as generic
algorithms to solve the problems. Several analysis tools
are also included.

Moreover, the core provides implementations of specific
components for subset selection.
