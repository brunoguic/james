James Core Module
=================

The James core module contains the core components of the James framework, including general classes modeling problems, objectives, constraints, solutions, search engines, etc. Moreover, the core module contains implementations of specific components for subset selection.

A wide range of generic neighbourhood searches are provided out-of-the-box, including

1. basic local search (random descent)
2. steepest descent
3. tabu search
4. variable neighbourhood search
5. Metropolis search
6. replica exchange Monte Carlo search (parallel tempering)

In addition, some specific subset sampling algorithms are available, as well as exhaustive search, which is of course only feasible for problems with a reasonably small search space.

Status
======

*James core module is currently under development.*
