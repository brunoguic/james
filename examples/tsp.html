        This example demonstrates how to implement and solve the travelling salesman problem, which is <em>not</em> a subset selection problem.
        The TSP consists of finding the shortest round trip that visits all cities from a given list exactly once and returns to the origin city.
        It is assumed that the travel distance from <var>a</var> to <var>b</var> is always equal to that from <var>b</var> to <var>a</var>
        (symmetric TSP). The input consists of a symmetric distance matrix. The goal is to find the optimal order (permutation) of cities
        yielding the lowest possible total travel distance.
    </p>

    <h4 class="page-header" id="solution-type">
        Designing a solution type
    </h4>
    <p>
        When defining a custom problem, the first step is to design the corresponding solution type. Here we create a <code>TSPSolution</code>
        class that models a solution to the TSP problem as a list of cities, in the order in which they are visited. Each city is represented
        by a unique integer value. The framework requires that all solution types extend the abstract <code>Solution</code> class which has
        three abstract methods to override:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <code>Solution copy()</code>: creates a deep copy of the solution. It is important that the returned copy is of exactly the
                same type as the original solution. Else, errors may occur during optimization. As it is allowed to set a
                more specific return type when overriding a method you might as well set it to <code>TSPSolution</code> instead of
                <code>Solution</code> (as in the example code below). In this example, the list of cities is copied into a new
                <code>TSPSolution</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>boolean equals(Object)</code>: the default implementation from the top-level <code>Object</code> class has been erased
                so that it is required to privde an appropriate equality check for every solution type. It is important that solutions are
                compared based on their contents (value-based) to guarantee correct behaviour of all search algorithms. In this example,
                the list of cities is compared (given that the other object is also a <code>TSPSolution</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>int hashCode()</code>: as usual, it is required to implement a custom hash code computation in correspondence
                with the custom definition of equality. Two equal solution should always produce the same hash code, different solutions
                <em>may</em> produce different hash codes (and should to guarantee optimal behaviour of e.g. hash-based collections).
            </li>
        </ol>
        A method <code>swapCities(i, j)</code> is provided to swap the two cities at the given positions. This will be used later when creating a neighbourhood.
    </p>

        Implementing the problem
    </h4>
    <p>
        Now we can specify the problem by implementing the <code>Problem</code> interface. This is a generic interface with one type parameter, the solution type,
        which is set to <code>TSPSolution</code>. A problem is reponsible for evaluating and validating solutions generated by search algorithms. It also provides
        a method to create a random solution and tells the search wether evaluations are to be minimized or maximized.
    </p>
    <p>
        A (symmetric) distance matrix is passed to our <code>TSPProblem</code> upon construction. It contains the travel distance between each pair of cities.
        Evaluation then comes down to computing the total travel distance that results from the order in which cities are visited in the given solution.
        Validation is trivial and always returns <code>SimpleValidation.PASSED</code>, a constant validation object
        that indicates that the solution passed validation. The total travel distance is to be minimized so <code>isMinimizing()</code> returns
        <code>true</code>. To create a random solution, a list with all cities is constructed, shuffled and wrapped in a <code>TSPSolution</code>.

        Providing a neighbourhood and corresponding move
    </h4>
    <p>
        To be able to apply the available neighbourhood searches we have to provide at least one neighbourhood for the new
        <code>TSPSolution</code> type. Here we create a neighbourhood that reverses a subsequence of cities in a given solution,
        by performing a series of swaps. This is often referred to as a 2-opt move in the context of (symmetric) TSP: all distances
        except the two at the border of the reversed subsequence are retained, and two new distances contribute to the total travel
        distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, provide the corresponding move by implementing the <code>Move</code> interface with solution type <code>TSPSolution</code>.
        This interface has two methods: one to apply the move and one to undo it after it has been applied to a solution. This specific
        move can be undone by again reversing the subsequence with the exact same code as for applying the move.

<pre class="prettyprint">

    <p>
        Then, create the neighbourhood itself by implementing the <code>Neighbourhood</code> interface, again with solution type <code>TSPSolution</code>.
        A neighbourhood has two methods: one to create a random move and one to obtain a list of all possible moves. Here, both methods create moves

        Efficient delta evaluation and validation
    </h4>
    <p>
        It is strongly advised (although optional) to also provide an efficient delta evaluation
        in the problem definition, exploiting the knowledge that a new solution is obtained
        by reversing a subsequence in the previous solution. This can be done by overriding the method
        <code>evaluate(Move, TSPSolution, Evaluation)</code> in our <code>TSPProblem</code>. Without
        this custom delta evaluation, moves are evaluated by applying them to the current solution,
        followed by a full evaluation, and finally undoing the applied move. Of course, this would
        be much slower.

    <p>
        Although full solution validation is not a bottleneck for this unconstrained problem,
        it is still beneficial to also provide a custom delta validation to avoid
        the cost of applying and undoing each considered move. Here, applying a move
        involves reversing a subsequence in the permutation, which is quite time consuming.
        We can easily avoid this by including an explicit delta validation that immediately
        returns <code>SimpleValidation.PASSED</code>. For this purpose, we override
        the method <code>validate(Move, TSPSolution, Validation)</code>.

        taking into account the scale of the evaluations. Here, this scale heavily depends on the precise travel distances between cities.

        The first line of the input file contains a single integer value (possibly surrounded by whitespace)
        that indicates the number of cities N. The remainder of the file contains the entries of the
        lower triangular part of an N &times; N symmetric distance matrix (row-wise without diagonal entries),
        separated by whitespace and/or newlines.
        The runtime is given in seconds.
