James
=====

James is an extensive Java framework for optimization using local search metaheuristics. The framework is mainly focused on subset selection, which has many applications in various areas, but other types of problems can also easily be implemented.

### Modules

The James framework consists of several modules:
 
 - [James Core Module][core-module]: as its name suggests, this module contains the core components of the framework. It includes many general concepts modelling problems, objectives, constraints, algorithms, neighbourhoods, etc.
 
   A wide range of generic local search algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including random descent, steepest descent, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search and parallel tempering. Exhaustive search is also available, which is of course only applicable to problems with a reasonable small search space.
   
   Moreover, the core module contains implementations of specific components for subset selection as well as some additional heuristics to be applied to subset sampling only.
   
 - [James Extensions Module][extensions-module]: this module extends the core with components to model and solve other types of problems besides subset selection (e.g. permutation problems). Also, general utilities for advanced problem specification, such as weighted multi-objective functions, are provided.
 
 - [James Examples Module][examples-module]: this module provides a series of example problem implementations as described at the [James website][examples-website].

Dependencies
============

James requires Java 7 or later.

To perform logging, James depends on the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)][slf4j], which is a general
logging API that provides bindings for several popular Java logging frameworks including log4j, JDK 1.4 logging
and logback. To send all log messages generated by James to your favorite logging framework, simply include
the appropriate binding on your classpath as described in the [SLF4J user manual][slf4j-manual]. If no binding is
found, a warning

```
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```

is printed to the console and all log messages are silently discarded. If you do not mind about log messages
it is perfectly safe to ignore this warning.

Download and install
====================

To get started with James, read the instructions on the [website][getstarted].

Building from source code
=========================

James is built using [Maven][maven], so compiling the source code should be as easy as running

```
mvn install
```

from inside the `james` root directory

```
|-- james
  |-- james-core
  |-- james-examples
  |-- james-extensions
  |-- pom.xml
```

assuming that [Maven][maven] has been installed on your computer. This will compile the code, create jar packages and install them in your local Maven repository, so that they can be added as dependencies in any other Maven project. After building James, you can also grab the created jar packages from the `target` directory of each module.

For the examples module, an additional jar including all dependencies is created in `james-examples/bin`.
To print an overview of the implemented examples and the corresponding usage information, execute

```
cd james-examples/bin
java -jar james-examples.jar
```

Documentation
=============

More information, user documentation and examples of how to use the framework are provided at the [James website][james-website]. Additional developer documentation is posted on the [wiki][james-wiki].
