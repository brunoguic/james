# James

James is an extensive java framework for applying metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems. The framework is mainly focused on subset selection, which has many applications in various areas, though other types of problems can also easily be plugged in.


A wide range of generic neighbourhood searches are provided out-of-the-box, including basic local search (random descent), steepest descent, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, etc. In addition, some specific subset sampling algorithms are available, as well as exhaustive search, which is of course only feasible for problems with a reasonably small search space.
