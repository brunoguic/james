# James

James is a java framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems using metaheuristics. The main focus of the framework is subset selection for all kinds of different applications, but other types of problems can easily be plugged in. A wide range of generic neighbourhood searches are provided out-of-the-box, including basic local search (random descent), steepest descent, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, etc. In addition, some specific subset selection algorithms are available, as well as exhaustive search.
